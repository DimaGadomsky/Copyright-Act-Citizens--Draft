= Copyright Act Draft Proposal =

== Term and Registration ==

* Copyright term 10 years from original date of fixation
* Entrench no retroactive changes to the term length  (extensions or reductions)
* Creators have 1 year to register copyright or the work enters the public
domain
** Registrations MUST be gratis to the creator
** The government MUST create an archive containing a copy of all registered
works
*** For works which cannot be copied directly (such as painting and sculptures)
a reasonable representation (such as a photograph) shall be sent to the
registry for inclusion in the archive
** Archive copies of works that are derivative of other works in the archive
MUST reference the archive entry for the original work
** The archive MUST NOT make available content that is not in the public domain
without the creator's permission but MUST make date of fixation, author's name
and other useful metadata (such as title) available

== Copyrightability ==

* Only the fixed form of an original, artistic work may be copyrighted
* Facts, ideas and compilations thereof are not copyrightable

== Exceptions ==

* Private noncommercial uses of creativity shall not be considered an
infringement
** A noncommercial use is any use that results in no direct compensation to the
user
** A private use is any use that will only ever involve a small number of
people // FIXME: chain reactions mean this could still end up involving tons of
people really fast.  How to clairify?  Could explicitly say "and the user has
no reason to believe that the others involved in the use will use it in such a
way that the use eventually involves enough people to be considered non-private"
** Such uses include: private study, backups, time and format shifting
* Commercial uses or public noncommercial uses MAY be considered non-infringing
if they are:
** Transformative or add substantial value to the original
** Non-substantial in relation to the original work
** Not substantially harmful to the market for the original work
** Such uses include most: parody, research, reporting, reviewing, classroom
use, background music at a noncommercial event
** The government MAY create collection policies to collect some fixed amount
per use from the user for use in compensating the original creator
*** Such collection policies MUST be such that a private citizen making a small
commercial use of the work could afford it

== Etc ==

* Publicly funded materials MUST be in the public domain
* Creators MAY dedicate their work explicitly to the public domain
* Service providers (such as ISPs, web hosts, and search engines) shall not be
liable for infringement by their users
